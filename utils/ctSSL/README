SSLyze's very own ctypes-based OpenSSL wrapper. 
https://github.com/iSECPartners/sslyze/

Mostly untested and in the process of being deprecated because OpenSSL and
ctypes do not work well together.

ctSSL is released under the MIT license.  See the LICENSE file for details.

Prerequisites: 
	Python 2.6 or 2.7 and OpenSSL 0.9.8+.
